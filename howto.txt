How to use EasyTTS

EasyTTS is an app that makes it easy to use text-to-speech on Windows. To use it, type whatever you want
to be spoken in the main text box. Then click the play button. That's it! There are three dropdown menus
also. The top one allows you to choose the 'voice', and the second one allows you to change the speed
of the voice (The Google voice speed cannot be changed.) The third one allows you to choose the language
of the text to want to convert to speech. In future versions, more languages will be added. Note that
to use any other language than English you must be connected to the Internet and use the Google
voice protocol.

Tips:
    Unlike previous versions of EasyTTS, you do not need to run the program as an administrator
    to use EasyTTS.

    When using the Google text-to-speech protocol, make sure you are connected to the Internet
    in order for the program to access Google's servers. If you are not connected to the Internet
    you may still use the offline Microsoft TTS protocols.

    You can also use the appropriate buttons to open a text file to be read or save the current
    contents of the text box as a text file.

Special Thanks to JS for the original concept of a text-to-speech app "so I get those voices like
they have on Macs."
