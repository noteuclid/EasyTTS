# EasyTTS
EasyTTS is a text-to-speech app. It basically a frontend for gTTS and pyttsx3. Please go to the project's website https://easytts.sourceforge.io for more information.

## Features
This app features multi-language support when the user is online, online/offline functionality, variable voice rate, reading data from text files, and more.

## Compiling

I installed PyInstaller and ran 
```pyinstaller --onedir --windowed --icon "speechico2.ico" "EasyTTS.py"```
but you can just use the .spec file.
